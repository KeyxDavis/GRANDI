# Mentorship Matching Platform

## Project Overview

The **Mentorship Matching Platform** is a web application designed to connect mentors and mentees within incubator or accelerator programs. It streamlines the mentorship process by enabling user registration, profile creation, mentor discovery, session scheduling, and feedback collection â€” all tailored to three distinct user roles: Admin, Mentor, and Mentee.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login with JWT and role-specific access controls.
- **User Profiles:** Users create detailed profiles including skills and goals.
- **Mentor Discovery:** Mentees browse and filter mentors by skills and industry.
- **Mentorship Requests:** Mentees send requests; mentors can accept or reject.
- **Session Scheduling:** Mentors set availability; mentees book sessions accordingly.
- **Session Feedback:** Mentees rate sessions and leave comments; mentors can add feedback.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage users, mentorship matches, and track session statistics.
